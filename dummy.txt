Both git fetch and git pull are used to update a local Git repository with changes from a remote repository, but they do so in different ways.
Git fetch downloads all of the commits from the remote repository into the local repository, but it does not merge them into the current branch. This means that you can see the changes that have been made, but you will not be able to see them in your working directory until you merge them.
Git pull, on the other hand, fetches the changes from the remote repository and then merges them into the current branch. This means that you can see the changes in your working directory immediately.
